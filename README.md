# Supply Chain Smart Contract

## Quick facts
* Contract: `https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xE69d8e4B820b3fc903a6D740e4Fd6AB2C655bdc5`
* Contract address: `0xE69d8e4B820b3fc903a6D740e4Fd6AB2C655bdc5`
* Transaction id: `0x31f1246644b93e0fecee50f1587b28407cc39cb5fc644699518a9dc2e9eceb2f`
* Node version: `v15.14.0`
* Truffle version: `5.4.14`
* Web3 version: `1.5.3`

Supporting libraries:
* Truffle: Helps us compile, test and deploy ethereum contracts to test, staging and production networks. 
* Truffle Assertions(v0.9.2): Helps us test events emitted by the contract.
* Web3: Helps us connect our frontend to our contract.

## General Write-up
These are the steps I followed for the implementation of the project.

1. *Planning*: Create UML diagrams to define the structure of the contract
2. *Code the contract*: Based on the diagrams, code the specific functionalities and classes.
3. *Test*: Test the main functionalities from the SupplyChain contract.
4. *Deploy*: Use truffle to deploy the contract to the Rinkeby network.
5. *Build the dApp*: Create a frontend interface to interact with the contract.
